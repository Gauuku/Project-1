# Project-1
I'm learning how to better use the seaborn library by separately analyzing qualitative data points and grouping non-qualitative with Product_category.
Occupation , Marital Status, Product Category and Purchase - Finding how correlated each element is to each other using .corr() 
Highly negative Correlation is found between Product_category and Purchase which means if one increases the other decreases 
Next we take Age, Gender and Product Category - shows red(High correlation) between 26-35 year old Male using the 1(Product_category) the most.And a high correlation between 26-35 Year old Male and the 5th(product_category)
